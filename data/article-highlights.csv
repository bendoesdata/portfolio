That’s up half a trillion dollars from 2015, when global subsidies stood at $4.7 trillion, according to the IMF. If governments had only accounted for these subsidies and priced fossil fuels at their “fully efficient levels” in 2015, then worldwide carbon emissions would have been 28 percent lower, and deaths due to toxic air pollution 46 percent lower.",https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/
"October 11, 2021 at 07:35AM",The Hidden Subsidy of Fossil Fuels,"Why does the IMF seem to overstate subsidies 17-fold? It comes back to its definition of subsidies. The report says they come in two flavors. First, there are pre-tax subsidies, which reflect the difference between what people pay for a fuel and what it cost to produce. This is what we usually mean when we say subsidy: Exxon might only be able to break even selling a gallon of gas for $3.50, but the government might decide that the best price for gasoline is actually $2.50. If it provisions public funds to pay this discount, then we would call the resulting $1 a subsidy.

But wait! Then the report adds that there is actually another kind of subsidy, which it calls a post-tax subsidy. This subsidy reflects the difference between “actual consumer fuel prices” and the full societal and environmental costs of a fuel.

These costs are very large: The burning of fossil fuels releases deadly air pollution, hastens the destruction of the climate, and (sometimes) increases traffic fatalities. And since all of those things kill people, they also depress a country’s tax base. Account for both the harms and the smaller tax base, says the IMF, and you produce an overwhelming number. In 2017, post-tax subsidies came to $4.9 trillion, or 94 percent of the total.

Those costs are very real. And they represent a subsidy of sorts: They are a grant of something valuable (our lungs, our home planet, our lives) to assist an enterprise deemed advantageous (the burning of fossil fuels). But they’re not entirely a grant of money to the oil companies.",https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/

For example, datasets are becoming extremely large and complex, often containing many dimensions. This makes it difficult to effectively and comprehensively display the data using standard visualization techniques, and it is often required to prioritize and filter the data to visualize only the information that is believed to be relevant. Importantly, this approach can involve making assumptions about the underlying information contained within the data, limiting the potential for making unexpected discoveries1. Visualization techniques can also be suboptimal for representing non-stationary data, for fast identification and for live data monitoring (for example, for transients2).

Focusing on visualization in both research and in educational contexts also naturally creates a barrier for people who are blind or vision impaired (BVI) to access astronomy knowledge, and related careers, starting from a very young age3.

"September 13, 2022 at 04:19PM",The Age of Algorithmic Anxiety,"Around the same time, Tarleton Gillespie, an academic who works for Microsoft’s research subsidiary, described how users were learning to shape what they posted to maximize their “algorithmic recognizability,” an effort that he compared to a speaker “turning toward the microphone” to amplify her voice. Content lived or died by S.E.O., or search-engine optimization, and those who learned to exploit its rules acquired special powers. Gillespie cites, as an example, when the advice columnist Dan Savage mounted a successful campaign, in 2003, to overwhelm the Google search results for Rick Santorum, the right-wing senator, with a vulgar sexual neologism.",https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-age-of-algorithmic-anxiety
"September 20, 2022 at 08:10AM",unselfing.social,"We are living through a pandemic of selfing — rampant self-celebration that mistakes applause for connection, likes for love. Social media companies are capitalizing on our native need for affirmation, exploiting our compromised immunity to manipulation at every turn: algorithms prioritizing selfies over sunflowers, algorithms amplifying the word I, algorithms doping us on the dopamine of being noticed, seducing us into forgetting the art and joy of noticing — that crowning glory of consciousness. And somewhere, in the quiet core of our being, this frantic hunt for likes is making us like ourselves less.",https://unselfing.social/
"September 23, 2022 at 09:25AM",Opinion | Mental Health Is Political,"Some social scientists have a term — “reification” — for the process by which the effects of a political arrangement of power and resources start to seem like objective, inevitable facts about the world. Reification swaps out a political problem for a scientific or technical one; it’s how, for example, the effects of unregulated tech oligopolies become “social media addiction,” how climate catastrophe caused by corporate greed becomes a “heat wave” — and, by the way, how the effect of struggles between labor and corporations combines with high energy prices to become “inflation.” Examples are not scarce.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html

If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You’re going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html

"October 25, 2022 at 08:14AM",These 10 Latin American Sound Artists Are Expanding What Ambient Music Can Be,"Leslie García is one of the most gifted sound artists in Latin America. For more than a decade, the Mexican musician has been interrogating the intersections between science, art, and technology, reimagining production techniques in the process. As founder of the Dream Addictive collective, which disbanded in 2010, she helped create sonic sculptures that responded to weather conditions using recycled materials and hardware. LogarDecay, an experimental duo she developed with collaborator Paloma López, has worked on projects that amplify plant material into sound. She is also part of Interspecifics, a Mexico City research collective interested in using sound, biosignals, and artificial intelligence to explore non-human forms of communication. Last year, Interspecifics released an audiovisual album developed with machine learning tools that analyze patterns of pollution in Mexico City, Bogotá, and São Paulo.",https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/these-latin-american-sound-artists-are-expanding-what-ambient-music-can-be/
