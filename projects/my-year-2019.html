            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>In 2019, I decided to intentionally track activities like working out, computer productivity, and listening to music. I relied on apps to track my steps, workouts, and app usage, and then analyzed the data at the end of the year.</p>
            <p>The result of this analysis was a series of posters visualizing a few key areas of my life. Most notably, this excercise in reflection through information design was inspired by the <a href="">Feltron reports</a>. I also wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/nightingale/my-year-in-data-a-visual-reflection-on-2019-e1545be7d680">blog post</a> to summarize how and why I made the site.</p>
