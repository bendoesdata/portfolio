### Music labels and artists want to know the value of Spotify. The insights team at Spotify needed new visual methods to discover, share and communicate findings from streaming data.

# The Project

The insights team at Spotify London had questions: what is the point of maximum ROI for programmed streams per song? How much should music managers invest before putting on the brakes? When are the most important boost times?

To answer these questions, Spotify used their analytic models to investigate. But they kept running into a problem: how do we effectively communicate our findings in a way that both informs and excites people?

In addition, Spotify was interested in using visualization as a way to not only answer questions, but to <strong style="font-weight: 600">ask new questions in the process</strong>.
