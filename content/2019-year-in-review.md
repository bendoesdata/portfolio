#### I spent most of 2019 tracking my personal data. In January of 2020, I spent some time visualizing it using only Javascript and the p5.js library.

## The Project

This was a self-initiated project. I wanted to design data visualizations that felt modern and fun. Most times the charts I make at work are highly technical in nature and focus on analytics. I wanted these visualizations to feel more like a poster you would hang on a wall.

I learned a lot from the experience. So much so that I wrote this retrospective blog on Medium. Here's a [friend link to the story](https://medium.com/nightingale/my-year-in-data-a-visual-reflection-on-2019-e1545be7d680?source=friends_link&sk=94f45721736dd8686008ba43153700c6) so you can bypass the paywall!
